# Want to learn a new language? Let's Go

These are the slides for the lightning talk to give at the workshop of RivieraDEV.

To start the slide show:

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- open http://localhost:3030 if not done automatically

The slides have built with [Slidev](https://github.com/slidevjs/slidev).
