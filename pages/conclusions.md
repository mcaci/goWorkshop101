# Conclusions

An hands-on introduction of Go

The objective today was to have some elements of Go and to start familiarizing with it

To have a first simple and complete overview of Go I recommend taking the [Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/)

You can use the [Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/) to quickly write and test snippets of Go code
- It is practical when you need to quickly test some Go code

You can look up here for the [official documentation of Go](https://go.dev/doc/) and the [list of packages](https://pkg.go.dev/)

The workshopâ€™s Github repo is public at [https://github.com/mcaci/lets-go-workshop](https://github.com/mcaci/lets-go-workshop)
